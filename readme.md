Plot iBeacon Broadcast Example
==============================
This example shows how to use your iOS device to broadcast an iBeacon signal.

When you want to test whether detecting iBeacons works, then you can just run this code. You can customise the UUID, majorId and minorId in ```Beacons.m```.

Due to limitations in iOS you have to keep this app in the foreground.

### Supported platforms ###
This example works on:
* iPhone 4S or newer
* iPad (3rd generation) or newer
* iPad Mini
